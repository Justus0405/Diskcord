# Diskcord

Diskcord is a lightweight daemon written in bash that monitors the health of your drives and sends periodic updates to a Discord channel via webhook. It checks S.M.A.R.T. data to provide detailed insights about your storage devices, helping you stay ahead of potential failures.

## Features

- Lightweight: The script is written in just a few hundret lines of bash code.
- Background Service: Runs continuously as a daemon to keep your drives under watch.
- S.M.A.R.T Monitoring: Checks various drive statistics.
- Discord Integration: Sends formatted notifications to your Discord webhook.
- Customizable: Select which drives to monitor and how often to check them.

## Notes

The check interval must be formatted as:

- 60s for seconds
- 60m for minutes
- 12h for hours
- 1d for days
- empty, run only once at boot

This allows Diskcord to schedule health checks at the desired frequency.

# Examples

Either run yourself once:

```shell
./diskcord
```

Or run in the background every 1h:

```shell
./diskcord install 1h
```
